# Iris KNN

Trains a machine learning (ML) model to classify iris flowers by species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Machine Learning fundamentals: supervised classification, training/testing splits, evaluation metrics.                        
Model implementation: training, fine-tuning, and testing constants

This project demonstrates how ML is used in order to make acurate predictions based on a data set.
